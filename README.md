# Splitter

ETH Community Blockstars 2.0's Project 1 - Splitter

## Specification

Create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

- There are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
- We can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
- Whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
- We can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
- Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.

Purposely left a lot to be decided. Such description approximates how your human project sponsors would describe the rules. As the Ethereum Smart Contract specialist, you have to think things through.

That's it! This is where you put hand to keyboard.

It would be even better if you could team up with different people impersonating Alice, Bob and Carol, all cooperating on a test net.

## Note

- This is a prototype, please don't use it unless you know what you are doing.
- A lot can be improved in this. Feedbacks are welcome
